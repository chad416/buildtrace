## Project overview

BuildTrace is a multi-tenant industrial SaaS platform for machine documentation and
service management, with an EU-first data-protection posture. Tenants manage machines,
upload and classify documents, raise service tickets, expose a public QR portal per
machine, and track delivered/current software versions. The product is in **Beta**
(about 95% complete; Phases 0-10 done, Phase 11 active).

## Stack

- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Web:** Next.js (App Router), `next-intl` i18n, Tailwind CSS, Zod
- **API:** NestJS
- **Worker:** background job processor (`apps/worker`)
- **DB:** Prisma + PostgreSQL on Supabase, multi-tenant with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Auth:** Supabase auth. Anon key in web Ã¢â€ â€™ JWT sent to NestJS Ã¢â€ â€™ **service-role key only in `apps/api`**, never in web
- **Tests:** Jest + per-package smoke scripts (e.g. `document-records:smoke`)
- **OS:** developed on Windows / PowerShell Ã¢â‚¬â€ package commands use `pnpm.cmd` locally, `pnpm` in CI/Unix

## Layout

```
apps/
  web/        Next.js front end (next-intl, Tailwind)
  api/        NestJS API (holds service-role key)
  worker/     background jobs
packages/
  db/         Prisma schema, migrations, RLS policies, tenant scoping
  shared/     shared types / utilities
  i18n/        translation messages and locale config
  ui/         shared UI components
docs/         project docs (do not edit unless asked)
```

Workspace package names: `@buildtrace/web`, `@buildtrace/api`, `@buildtrace/worker`,
`@buildtrace/db`, `@buildtrace/shared`, `@buildtrace/i18n`, `@buildtrace/ui`.

## Locales

`en` (default), `cs`, `sk`, `pl`, `de`, `fr`, `es`.
All user-facing text comes from translation keys. **No hardcoded visible UI strings.**

## Commands (verification gates)

Run these after any change and before declaring work done. On Windows use `pnpm.cmd`.

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
pnpm format:check     # if it fails: run `pnpm format`, then re-run all gates
pnpm dev:preflight    # combined pre-dev check
```

Targeted per-package (faster while iterating):

```bash
pnpm --filter @buildtrace/web typecheck
pnpm --filter @buildtrace/web run document-records:smoke
pnpm --filter @buildtrace/api run document-records:smoke
git diff --check      # catch whitespace / conflict markers
```

## Conventions

- Strict TypeScript. No `any` escape hatches to make types pass.
- Make the **smallest correct change** for the task. No drive-by refactors.
- **Root-cause fixes, not workarounds.** Do not patch files with brittle regex/text-anchor
  surgery Ã¢â‚¬â€ edit the actual source cleanly. If an edit doesn't apply, re-read the file and
  fix the real cause.
- Tenant isolation is non-negotiable: every data path must respect RLS / tenant scoping.
- Use translation keys for all user-facing copy.
- Keep changes scoped to the current phase; do not jump ahead into future work.

## Do not touch / do not add (unless the task explicitly says so)

- The Supabase **service-role key** anywhere outside `apps/api`.
- Auth, RLS, or tenant-scoping logic as a side effect of an unrelated task.
- `packages/db` schema or migrations without an explicit migration task.
- `docs/**`, generated files, build caches, `node_modules`.
- New heavy deps (e.g. `shadcn/ui`, `lucide-react`) unless the task asks for them.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly told to.

## Definition of done

1. Files changed (list them)
2. Commands run
3. Gate results (typecheck / lint / build / format:check)
4. Any warnings or errors and how they were handled
5. Confirmation that no out-of-scope work (auth/db/storage/tenant/etc.) was added

## Phase 10 Current State

Phase 7 - QR customer portal is complete and closed.
Phase 8 - Service tickets + support session is complete and closed.
Phase 9 - Software version timeline is complete and closed.
Phase 10 - Spare parts intelligence + quote tracking is complete and closed.
Phase 11 - Feedback, audit log, security polish, deployment is active.

The full beta roadmap is about 95% complete.

Completed Phase 10 pieces:

- DB spare_parts and quote_requests schema + migration
- DB spare part and quote request helpers
- authenticated spare parts API endpoints
- authenticated quote request API endpoints
- public QR portal quote request creation endpoint
- internalCost never returned by API responses
- customerAccessToken never returned in builder list/get responses
- web spare parts API client and machine detail UI
- web quote requests API client and machine detail UI
- web portal quote request form
- spare parts and quote request copy for all 7 locales
- activity logging for spare part and quote request actions

## Phase 11 Active

Phase 11 - Feedback, audit log, polish, deployment scope from the roadmap:

- private feedback
- activity log dashboard
- demo data
- empty states
- loading states
- error states
- production deployment
- monitoring
- backup/export plan
- security polish
- final access-control checklist

## Hard Warning For Future AI Agents

Do not reopen Phase 10 unless a real defect is found.

Do not implement AI/OCR/vector search/worker queues for Phase 5.

Do not let classification change visibility or customer exposure automatically.

Do not apply suggested category without explicit builder action.

Do not do brittle workaround edits. Re-read files and make root-cause fixes.

Never commit secrets, Supabase service-role keys, access tokens, refresh tokens, database URLs, passwords, or private keys.
